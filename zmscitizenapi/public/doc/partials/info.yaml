      The ZMSCitizenAPI builds upon the ZMSApi to provide an interface specifically designed for external citizens. Its key features include:

      * Citizens can select services and providers (locations) from ZMS sources.
      * Citizens can book ZMS appointments via an integrated calendar and email system, enabling a seamless process for managing appointments.
      * Citizens can modify or reschedule ZMS appointments through the same calendar and email functionality.

      This documentation provides detailed API-level guidance for accessing the Citizen Frontend (BÃ¼rgeransicht) features.
