-- Version 1 is intentionally empty.
-- Flyway is configured with -baselineOnMigrate=true, so it inserts
-- its own "<< Flyway Baseline >>" row at version 1 before running
-- the actual migrations.
-- Keeping this placeholder makes the numbering explicit and prevents
-- real migrations from accidentally reusing version 1.
